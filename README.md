## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS Grid and how to make it fit the screen where it is being displayed.

```css
.container {
    margin: 100px 150px;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue developing and using CSS Grid to improve my CSS Grid skills.
